# RadEdit

RadEdit is a minimal WinForms host around the `RichTextBox` control designed to work in tandem with automation tools such as AutoHotkey. The application exposes a small set of commands over `WM_COPYDATA`, allowing external scripts to push RTF content in, insert snippets at the current selection, or pull the current document out to a temporary file.

## Building / Running

```powershell
# build
dotnet build

# run for development
dotnet run --project RadEdit.csproj
```

A Debug build targets `net8.0-windows` and produces `bin\Debug\net8.0-windows\RadEdit.exe`.

## Window Overview

- Top tool strip contains:
  - Title label (left)
  - Name label (center)
  - Bold/Italic/Underline buttons that operate on the current selection
- Main editor surface is a standard `RichTextBox` with URL detection disabled and vertical scroll bars.

## WM_COPYDATA Commands

RadEdit listens for `WM_COPYDATA` messages whose `dwData` matches one of the following command identifiers. The payload must be UTF-16 text (trailing null is optional).

| Command | `dwData` | Payload | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `SetRtfText` | 1 | RTF text | Replaces the entire document with the supplied RTF. Empty payload clears the editor. |
| `InsertRtfText` | 2 | RTF text | Inserts/overwrites at the current selection using `SelectedRtf`. |
| `SetRtfFile` | 3 | File path | Loads an RTF file from disk into the editor (replaces content). Relative paths resolve against the RadEdit process working directory. |
| `InsertRtfFile` | 4 | File path | Inserts the contents of the RTF file at the current selection. |
| `RequestTempFile` | 5 | Optional path or filename | Saves the current document to an RTF file and returns the absolute path via a `TempFileResponse` (see below). If the payload is relative, the file is created under `%TEMP%`; otherwise an absolute path is respected. Without a payload, a file named after the window title is generated under `%TEMP%`. |
| `TempFileResponse` | 6 | File path | Response emitted by RadEdit for `RequestTempFile`. |
| `ErrorResponse` | 7 | Error text | Response emitted if a command throws an exception (file not found, bad payload, etc.). |
| `SetTitle` | 8 | Title text | Updates the title label on the tool strip. The window caption remains `RadEdit`. |
| `GetTitle` | 9 | *(ignored)* | RadEdit responds with `TitleResponse` containing the current title. |
| `TitleResponse` | 10 | Title text | Response emitted for `GetTitle`. |
| `SetName` | 11 | Name text | Updates the centered name label on the tool strip. |

> **Note**: RadEdit does not currently emit responses for commands other than `RequestTempFile`/`GetTitle`, but callers should always check for an `ErrorResponse` to surface issues.

## AutoHotkey Integration Example

```ahk
WM_COPYDATA := 0x4A
CMD := Map("SetRtf", 1, "InsertRtf", 2, "SetFile", 3, "InsertFile", 4
          , "RequestTemp", 5, "SetTitle", 8, "GetTitle", 9, "SetName", 11)

target := WinExist("ahk_exe RadEdit.exe")
if !target {
    MsgBox "RadEdit window not found"
    ExitApp
}

; replace document by loading an RTF snippet
SendCopyData(target, CMD["SetRtf"], "{\rtf1\ansi Hello, world!}")

; update labels
SendCopyData(target, CMD["SetTitle"], "Patient Summary")
SendCopyData(target, CMD["SetName"], "Dr. Example")

; request a temp file and capture the response
OnMessage(WM_COPYDATA, CopyDataHandler)
SendCopyData(target, CMD["RequestTemp"], "RadEditOutput")
return

CopyDataHandler(wParam, lParam, msg, hwnd) {
    static CMD_TEMP := 5, CMD_TEMP_RESP := 6, CMD_ERROR := 7
    cmd := NumGet(lParam, 0, "UPtr")
    size := NumGet(lParam, A_PtrSize, "UInt")
    text := StrGet(NumGet(lParam, 2*A_PtrSize, "Ptr"), size/2, "UTF-16")
    if (cmd = CMD_TEMP_RESP) {
        MsgBox "Temp file created: " text
    } else if (cmd = CMD_ERROR) {
        MsgBox "RadEdit error: " text
    }
    return true
}

SendCopyData(hwnd, command, text := "") {
    text := text . Chr(0)
    buf := Buffer(StrLen(text) * 2, 0)
    StrPut(text, buf, "UTF-16")
    cds := Buffer(3 * A_PtrSize, 0)
    NumPut("UPtr", command, cds, 0)
    NumPut("UInt", buf.Size, cds, A_PtrSize)
    NumPut("Ptr", buf.Ptr, cds, 2 * A_PtrSize)
    DllCall("user32\SendMessageW", "Ptr", hwnd, "UInt", WM_COPYDATA, "Ptr", A_ScriptHwnd, "Ptr", cds.Ptr, "Ptr")
}
```

## Troubleshooting

- **SetRtf/InsertRtf fails silently**: ensure the payload is valid RTF (e.g., starts with `{\rtf`).
- **File operations fail**: RadEdit relays exceptions via `ErrorResponse`. Check the returned text for the detailed message (e.g., file not found).
- **Temp file command**: the recipient handle (`wParam`) must be non-zero so RadEdit knows where to send the response.

## Future Ideas

- Macro management and toolbar integration (previous experiment removed for now).
- Additional status reporting (caret position, selection info).
- Optional plain-text commands for quick snippets.
